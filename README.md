## What is Node.js?

![logo](logo.png)


Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building
fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking
I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
